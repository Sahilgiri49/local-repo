# Netflix Clone

This is my first project: a **Netflix Clone**! The project replicates the front-end design of Netflix using **HTML** and  **CSS**. It showcases my understanding of web development and aims to provide a similar user interface and experience to Netflix.

## Features

- **Homepage UI**: Replicates the Netflix homepage with banners, movies, and TV shows categorized into rows.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
- **Carousel Effect**: Allows scrolling through movies within a row.
- **Hover Effects**: Displays additional details when hovering over a movie.
- **Search Bar**: A functional search bar (if implemented).

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the web pages.
- **CSS**: For styling the elements and creating responsive designs.
